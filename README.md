# NumGuessr

Hello, and welcome to NumGuessr, a text-based number-guessing game. The title of the game might look weird, but it's just a wordplay on GeoGuessr.

## What it entails

The player will be playing against the computer, which starts off by thinking of a number between 1 and 100. The player can then choose between easy mode and hard mode. If the user selects easy mode, they have 10 attempts to guess the number, while if they select hard mode, they only have 5 attempts. Once the player has selected their difficulty level, the game kicks off. If the player makes a guess that is higher than the number, they will be notified that their guess is too high, and their total number of attempts will be reduced. The same thing will happen if their guess is lower than the number. The number is revealed if the player runs out of guesses, and the game ends. However, if the player makes the correct guess before running out of attempts, they will be notified that they got the number, and the game ends immediately. The player can choose to restart the game or exit it.

## How to play

Just run the code and enjoy the game. Hope you have fun playing NumGuessr.
